## Drink API

This is just me practicing using API's while messing around with the layout.

# issues

I'm not sure if it is me or the API won't let me array through the ingredients.
I have tried multiple ways to try and add an index to the end of the ingredients because it is hardcoded in

```
strIngredient1
strIngredient2
etc...
```

## Notes

Right now I am using details and summary which lists all the available drinks from the alcohol that was input
You can click on any drink and it will load that drink.
I will probably switch it to a ul list maybe ol. I may embed them into radio buttons.
